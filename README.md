#STREAM-SYNC
StreamSync is a web app that seamlessly converts playlists from Spotify, JioSaavn, and Gaana into YouTube playlists. 
It allows users to enter a playlist URL, extracts the song names, and provides direct YouTube linksâ€”eliminating the need to search for each song manually or create accounts on multiple platforms. 
Built with Java Spring Boot and a simple JS/HTML frontend, StreamSync makes cross-platform music sharing effortless. ðŸŽ¶ðŸš€
